### 문제 설명

<p>You would like to implement a simple simulation of gravity on a 2-dimensional grid, consisting of n rows and m columns.</p>

<p>Some grid cells may contain obstacles, some may contain a single apple, and all others are empty.</p>

<p>The following rules are followed until no further changes are possible:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The obstacles do not move.</li>
	<li>Whenever there is an empty cell immediately below an apple, the apple moves into the empty cell.</li>
</ul>

<p>Find the final configuration of the grid after all apples have settled.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 50).</p>

<p>Each of the next n lines contains m characters, describing the board, from top to bottom. Obstacles are denoted as ‘#’, apples are denoted as ‘o’, and empty cells are denoted as ‘.’.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Print, on n lines, the final configuration of the grid after executing the rules stated above.</p>
