### 문제 설명

<p>Once upon a time, you had a nice positive integer $n$.</p>

<p>Since you like division, you quickly found all its positive integer divisors.</p>

<p>Not being a mean guy, you calculated $a$ --- the arithmetic mean of divisors of $n$. Surprisingly, this number turned out to be an integer.</p>

<p>Some time passed, and you calculated $h$ --- the harmonic mean of divisors of $n$. Even more surprisingly, this number turned out to be an integer, too!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, your memory let you down, and now you remember $a$ and $h$ but don't remember $n$. However, you remember that $n$ didn't exceed $10^{15}$.</p>

<p>Your muse suggested to bring good old times back and restore any value of $n$ matching your records.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of the input contains a single positive integer $a$.</p>

<p>The second line of the input contains a single positive integer $h$.</p>

<p>It's guaranteed that there exists a positive integer $n \le 10^{15}$ such that the arithmetic mean of divisors of $n$ is equal to $a$, which the harmonic mean of divisors of $n$ is equal to $h$.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output any positive integer $n$ not exceeding $10^{15}$ which doesn't contradict the given information.</p>
