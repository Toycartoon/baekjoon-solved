### 문제 설명

<p>You have received a warning that foreign spies may have infiltrated the great country of Canada. Fortunately, you have developed a foolproof method to determine which potential suspects are truly Canadian: A person is a <i>true</i> Canadian if and only if they end every sentence exactly with <code>eh?</code> .</p>

<p>Given the transcript of a sentence spoken by a suspected spy, write a program to determine if the suspect is truly Canadian…or merely an imposter in disguise!</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input consists of a single line, which is the sentence spoken by the suspect. The line will contain between $3$ and $100$ characters (inclusively). It will also only contain English letters, digits, spaces, and punctuation symbols.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Display <code>Canadian!</code> if the speaker is a true Canadian following the above criteria, otherwise display <code>Imposter!</code> .</p>
